# PC Stress Testing Scripts

They are **not** meant for casual use.

## ⚠️ Important Safety Notice

This repository contains a collection of scripts designed to stress test a computer’s hardware, including:

- **CPU** (high computation, multi-threaded workloads)
<!--
- **Memory (RAM)** (large allocations, read/write pressure)
- **GPU** (graphics/compute workloads)
-->

These scripts are intended for:
- Hardware stability testing
- Thermal and power limit validation
- Benchmarking and performance analysis
- Troubleshooting system crashes or throttling

Running stress-testing scripts can:

- Push your hardware to **100% utilization**
- Cause **high temperatures**
- Increase **power consumption**
- Trigger **thermal throttling**
- Cause **system instability, freezes, or crashes**
- Potentially lead to **hardware damage** if cooling or power delivery is insufficient
